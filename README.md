- [sloatomic_train.tsv](data/sloatomic_train.tsv): The training set.
- [sloatomic_dev.tsv](data/sloatomic_dev.tsv): The development set.
- [sloatomic_test.tsv.automatic_all](data/sloatomic_test.tsv.automatic_all): The test set containing all of the automatically translated examples.
- [sloatomic_test.tsv.automatic_10k](data/sloatomic_test.tsv.automatic_10k): The selection of 10k examples from the complete test set.
- [sloatomic_test.tsv.manual_10k](data/sloatomic_test.tsv.manual_10k): The manually inspected and fixed examples of the _automatic 10k_ subset.
